  "feedback": "The review is concise and effective in highlighting both strengths and weaknesses of the report. It clearly identifies actionable areas for improvement, such as the absence of quantitative evaluation and baseline comparisons. To further enhance its value, the reviewer could consider offering specific suggestions or examples for how to address the identified problems, rather than just stating what's missing. For instance, suggesting types of quantitative metrics or specific baseline data that would be relevant could make the feedback even more constructive."
